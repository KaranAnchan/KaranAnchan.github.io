## 💼 Work Experience

### **Machine Learning Intern | Wizdom Ed**
*Mangalore, India | Oct 2023 – Apr 2024* 

* **RAG Pipeline Development:** Created a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using **LangChain** and **ChromaDB** to relate LLM responses to course curriculum, reducing hallucinations through system constraints.
* **Data Ingestion Optimization:** Built ingestion workflows using recursive character splitting and dynamic overlap strategies to preserve semantic context.
    * **Impact:** Resulted in a **35% increase** in student engagement with practice tests.
* **Feedback Loops:** Established a retrieval quality feedback loop by monitoring low cosine similarity queries to pinpoint curriculum gaps.
    * **Impact:** Achieved a **30% boost** in positive response rates and a **25% improvement** in learning outcomes.

## 🚀 Key Projects

### **UNETR 3D Abdomen Segmentation**
*Stack: PyTorch, UNETR, MONAI, DICOM/NIFTI* 

* **Architecture:** Architected a volumetric segmentation pipeline using the **UNETR (Vision Transformer)** architecture on the BTCV dataset to capture global context dependencies for 13 distinct abdominal organs[cite: 33].
* **Preprocessing:** Engineered a robust workflow utilizing Hounsfield Unit (HU) windowing and isometric resampling to normalize soft-tissue density[cite: 34].
* **Optimization:** Addressed class imbalance using compound Dice-Cross Entropy loss and foreground-biased sampling.
* **Result:** Achieved a **0.8027 Mean Dice Score**, validated through sliding window inference with Gaussian overlap.

### **Neural Machine Translation (English-Hindi)**
*Stack: PyTorch, Transformers, Altair* 
* **Model Development:** Developed and trained a Transformer-based NMT model from scratch using PyTorch on the IIT Bombay English-Hindi corpus.
* **Performance:** Achieved a **SacreBLEU score of 62.48** and a **CHRF++ score of 71.78**, reducing the Character Error Rate (CER) to 0.28.
* **Visualization:** Implemented custom data pipelines and attention visualization tools to verify encoder-decoder alignment.
