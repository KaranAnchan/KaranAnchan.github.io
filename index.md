## 💼 Work Experience

### **Machine Learning Intern | Wizdom Ed**
*Mangalore, India | [cite_start]Oct 2023 – Apr 2024* [cite: 24, 25, 26]

* [cite_start]**RAG Pipeline Development:** Created a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using **LangChain** and **ChromaDB** to relate LLM responses to course curriculum, reducing hallucinations through system constraints[cite: 27].
* [cite_start]**Data Ingestion Optimization:** Built ingestion workflows using recursive character splitting and dynamic overlap strategies to preserve semantic context[cite: 28].
    * [cite_start]**Impact:** Resulted in a **35% increase** in student engagement with practice tests[cite: 28].
* [cite_start]**Feedback Loops:** Established a retrieval quality feedback loop by monitoring low cosine similarity queries to pinpoint curriculum gaps[cite: 29].
    * [cite_start]**Impact:** Achieved a **30% boost** in positive response rates and a **25% improvement** in learning outcomes[cite: 29].

## 🚀 Key Projects

### **UNETR 3D Abdomen Segmentation**
[cite_start]*Stack: PyTorch, UNETR, MONAI, DICOM/NIFTI* [cite: 31, 32]

* [cite_start]**Architecture:** Architected a volumetric segmentation pipeline using the **UNETR (Vision Transformer)** architecture on the BTCV dataset to capture global context dependencies for 13 distinct abdominal organs[cite: 33].
* [cite_start]**Preprocessing:** Engineered a robust workflow utilizing Hounsfield Unit (HU) windowing and isometric resampling to normalize soft-tissue density[cite: 34].
* [cite_start]**Optimization:** Addressed class imbalance using compound Dice-Cross Entropy loss and foreground-biased sampling[cite: 35].
* [cite_start]**Result:** Achieved a **0.8027 Mean Dice Score**, validated through sliding window inference with Gaussian overlap[cite: 36].
